1. How much time (in miliseconds) does it take for each thread to complete its task?
- single-threaded version: main thread | ~ <b>4000 Milliseconds</b>
- multi-threaded version: main thread, thread 1 and thread 2 |  <b>2000 Milliseconds</b>
2. In the multi-threaded version does main thread time == thread 1 time + thread 2 time?
   - <b>No they run at the same time</b>
3. Which method (single-thread or multi-thread) results in a faster execution time? Explain why the given version is faster than the other.
   - <b>Multi Thread</b>
4. In the Step 4 - Execution section above, why are there two possible outputs for the same code?
   - <b>no order</b>
